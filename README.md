# Commuting-Data-Project

# Intro

This is a data science project I started to convince myself to stop stressing on my commute to work. I asked myself the question, "How much time am I really saving when I rush on my drive to work? What is it costing me to drive faster?" I drive a 2016 prius, it can't really cost that much to save a bit of time, right? From those initial questions the project grew with more questions, and eventually  to be more of practicing data analysis skills and since I had a unique data set that I was intimately familiar with a fun way to learn new skills. This project has turned into a personal data analysis skills portfolio, as I work in a field where many people have open publications, while I have been at commercial firms my entire career and have no demonstration of my skills that I can openly share.  

# The Data

All data was collected by me, and logged into a google drive spreadsheet at the completion of each commute. Anyone interested has my blessing to use the data for practice and learning.
